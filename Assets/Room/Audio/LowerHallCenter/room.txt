You are standing right in the centre of the Lower Hall. Look up to admire this central part of the painted ceiling. You may need to turn your view around to correct the orientation. The painting is titled 'The Triumph of Peace and Liberty over Tyranny' and it depicts William III and Mary II with their coronation regalia. As founders of the Royal Hospital for Seamen, William and Mary take centre stage in the painting.
