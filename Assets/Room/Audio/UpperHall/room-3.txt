Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark

Queen Anne, who ruled from 1702 to 1714 was Mary's younger sister: she succeeded William and Mary to the throne. Anne died, childless, before this painting was completed, so instead of featuring on the west wall of the Upper Hall she and her consort (Prince George of Denmark) were relegated to the ceiling.
