Welcome to the Upper Hall, the third great space within the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College, completed between 1717 and 1725. You are standing in the centre of the Upper Hall.

The Upper Hall presents us with four significant scenes. On the west wall, straight ahead, we are introduced to the new Hanoverian dynasty, with George I taking centre stage.

Look up to the ceiling and you will see Queen Anne and her consort, Prince George of Denmark.

Look to each of the side walls and you will find grisaille paintings, purposefully finished in monochrome to make them appear like stone sculptures.

Look down. There are two commemorative plaques, one for Britain's greatest naval hero, Vice Admiral Horatio Lord Nelson, whose body lay in state on this spot in January 1806, and the other for Vice Admiral Cuthbert Lord Collingwood, who led HMS Sovereign during the Battle of Trafalgar.

There is a lot more detail you can explore by physically visiting the Painted Hall.
