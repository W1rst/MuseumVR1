The arrival of King George I
George I is shown arriving in England in 1714 on a chariot, accompanied by a mounted St George with a slain dragon underfoot. The painting is designed to create the impression that his arrival was as confident and triumphant as that of William III, less than 30 years earlier. But, in reality, George's arrival on a foggy night was unimpressive.
