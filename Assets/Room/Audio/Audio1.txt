You are standing at the centre of the Vestibule, which is at the East end of the Painted Hall. The Vestibule is the first in a sequence of three great spaces that make up the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College. It is a lofty space, covered by a domed ceiling. As well as serving as a grand entrance hall it features the names of those who helped fund the building of Greenwich Hospital.

Although the first space we encounter, it was the last part of the Painted Hall to be painted - it was completed in 1726.

Look up! The tall columns lead your eye up to the soaring dome, 45 metres above your head. Zoom in to examine the four main figures representing the four winds. At the centre of the dome is the eight-pointed star, the symbol of the Order of the Garter. In the four corners surrounding the dome, you will see the royal ciphers.

Zoom in to the donor boards above the main doors. Like much of the decorative detail here, the figures of the boys framing these boards are painted, but made to look sculpted. This is typical of a technique known by the French phrase trompe l'oeil, which means 'trick the eye'.

There are plenty more details which you can explore by paying a physical visit.
